It covers the journey from general-purpose HPC profilers to highly specialized, trace-driven simulators designed to tackle the complexities of today’s large-scale models. This post is intended to provide the reader with a broad intuition about this field, synthesizing findings from key research papers.</p> <p>Preface. The field of deep learning has flourished in the past decade, and with it, the systems that run these models have grown astronomically complex. Training a foundation model can involve thousands of GPUs running for weeks, making performance efficiency not just a goal, but a necessity. Understanding why a model is slow, identifying bottlenecks, and predicting the impact of optimizations are critical challenges. This has spurred a parallel evolution in performance measurement, analysis, and modeling tools, moving from generic profilers to sophisticated, trace-driven simulators that can accurately capture and predict the behavior of massive, distributed ML workloads. This post chronicles that evolution, drawing on a selection of key research papers that have defined the state of the art.</p> <p>Part I. The Beginning (The HPC Era)</p> <p>Before deep learning dominated the landscape, the world of high-performance computing (HPC) had long grappled with performance analysis for complex, parallel programs. Tools from this era were built to be portable and general-purpose, supporting a wide array of programming languages (Fortran, C++, MPI) and architectures.</p> <p>A prime example is the TAU Performance System <d-cite key="huck-et-al-2025-preparing-the-tau-performance-system-for-exascale-and-beyond"></d-cite>. As a portable profiling and tracing toolkit, TAU was designed to gather performance data through instrumentation or sampling, providing insights into function calls, basic blocks, and more. Its adaptability allowed it to run on virtually all DOE HPC systems, from pre-exascale machines like Titan to the exascale systems of today. This focus on portability and comprehensive measurement across different programming models laid the groundwork for the types of analysis that would become crucial for ML systems. However, the unique, graph-based execution model and the sheer scale of deep learning would soon demand a new, more specialized generation of tools.</p> <p>Part II. Oh s*** — Deep learning works! (2012 - 2020)</p> <p>With the breakthrough success of models like AlexNet, the research community and industry rapidly developed dedicated deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. This shift created a need for tools that understood the specific constructs of these frameworks, moving beyond generic function profiling to analyze the performance of operators, kernels, and the underlying computational graphs.</p> <p>II.1: The Rise of Framework-Specific Profilers</p> <p>To address the unique challenges of debugging ML models, frameworks began incorporating built-in profiling tools. These tools integrated with low-level hardware-specific APIs, like NVIDIA’s CUDA Profiling Tools Interface (CUPTI) <d-cite key="2_Fine_grained_Trace_driven_Pe.pdf"></d-cite>, to provide a holistic view of the execution stack, from the host CPU down to the individual GPU kernels.</p> <p>The <strong>PyTorch Profiler</strong>, powered by <strong>Kineto</strong>, is a prominent example. It captures runtime information for PyTorch operators, CUDA runtime API calls, and GPU kernel executions. This includes critical metadata like start times, durations, CUDA stream IDs, and correlation IDs that link CPU-side operations to their corresponding GPU-side kernels. This ability to generate detailed, multi-level traces became the foundational data source for a new wave of performance analysis techniques. Similarly, large-scale deployments like those at Facebook developed extensive telemetry infrastructures, using CUPTI-based libraries to continuously collect performance counters (e.g., SM efficiency, achieved occupancy) and on-demand traces from every workflow across the datacenter fleet <d-cite key="Datacenter-Scale_Analysis_and_Optimization_of_GPU_Machine_Learning_Workloads.pdf"></d-cite>.</p> <p>II.2: Early Trace-Based Performance Models</p> <p>With the availability of detailed execution traces, researchers began developing performance models to simulate and predict training performance. These early tools aimed to answer “what-if” questions about the efficacy of potential optimizations without the cost of running real experiments.</p> <p>Daydream <d-cite key="Zhu_2020"></d-cite> was a notable early effort that used kernel-level dependency graphs collected with CUPTI to predict model runtime under specific optimizations. It worked by constructing a graph where nodes represented tasks and edges represented dependencies, allowing for simulation of the critical path. Similarly, dPRO <d-cite key="hu2022dpro"></d-cite> tracked dependencies among operators to build a global dataflow graph to estimate DNN training performance.</p> <p>However, these pioneering tools had a significant limitation: they did not fully account for the complexities of modern distributed training, particularly the use of multiple concurrent CUDA streams and the intricate dependencies between them. As model parallelism and techniques for overlapping computation with communication became commonplace, this gap led to inaccuracies, especially for the large-scale models that were just over the horizon <d-cite key="2_Fine_grained_Trace_driven_Pe.pdf,2504.09307v1.pdf"></d-cite>.</p> <p>Part III. The Era of Scale till we Fail (2020 - Now)</p> <p>The advent of massive models like GPT-3 marked a new era. The complexity of training and inference, often involving hybrid parallelism strategies across thousands of GPUs, pushed existing performance analysis tools to their limits. A new generation of tools and methodologies emerged, focusing on creating highly accurate, fine-grained models of execution that could handle the intricacies of modern LLMs.</p> <p>III.1: The Need for a Common Language - Standardized Execution Traces</p> <p>As different organizations (model developers, hardware vendors, cloud providers, academics) began collaborating on co-design and optimization, the lack of a common format for performance data became a major bottleneck. Each framework and tool produced traces in its own proprietary format, hindering the exchange of information.</p> <p>The Chakra project was proposed to solve this problem by introducing a standardized, open-source schema for execution traces (ETs) <d-cite key="sridharan2023chakra"></d-cite>. An ET is a graph-based representation of a model’s execution, capturing key computational and communication operations, their properties (e.g., tensor shapes, data sizes), and their dependencies.</p> <p>The Chakra schema was designed to be:</p> <ul> <li>Minimal yet Extensible: It defines a core set of required fields (ID, name, type, parents) and uses a flexible attribute system for adding custom metadata. This allows it to be adapted for various tools and use cases.</li> <li>Framework-Agnostic: By providing converters from framework-specific traces (like PyTorch’s) to the Chakra ET format, it enables a unified ecosystem of tools.</li> <li>Protective of IP: Sharing full model details is often impossible due to proprietary IP. ETs provide a level of abstraction, capturing the performance-critical aspects of a workload without revealing the underlying model weights or architecture. Chakra also proposes using generative models to synthesize realistic but anonymized ETs for wider sharing.</li> </ul> <p>By creating a “lingua franca” for performance data, Chakra aims to foster a vibrant ecosystem of interoperable simulators, benchmarks, and analysis tools to accelerate AI system co-design.</p> <p>III.2: Advanced Trace-Driven Simulation for LLMs</p> <p>Building on the foundation of standardized traces, a new generation of simulators emerged to address the shortcomings of earlier tools. Frameworks like TraceSim <d-cite key="2_Fine_grained_Trace_driven_Pe.pdf"></d-cite> and Lumos <d-cite key="2504.09307v1.pdf"></d-cite> are designed specifically to model the complex execution of large-scale LLM training.</p> <p>Their key innovation lies in the construction of a much more comprehensive execution graph. Unlike older tools, they explicitly model all four crucial dependency types:</p> <ol> <li>CPU-to-CPU: Both intra-thread (sequential operations) and inter-thread (e.g., forward pass blocking the backward pass) dependencies.</li> <li>CPU-to-GPU: Kernel launches (e.g., cudaLaunchKernel) that initiate GPU work.</li> <li>GPU-to-CPU: Synchronization events (e.g., cudaDeviceSynchronize) where the CPU waits for the GPU.</li> <li>GPU-to-GPU: Both intra-stream (sequential kernels on the same stream) and, critically, inter-stream dependencies. These are managed via events like cudaEventRecord and cudaStreamWaitEvent and are essential for accurately modeling the overlap of computation and communication.</li> </ol> <p>By capturing this fine level of detail, these tools can achieve very high accuracy. Lumos, for instance, replayed the execution time of various GPT-3 models with an average error of just 3.3% <d-cite key="2504.09307v1.pdf"></d-cite>. TraceSim achieved 95.6% accuracy in reproducing execution time on a 256-GPU cluster <d-cite key="2_Fine_grained_Trace_driven_Pe.pdf"></d-cite>. This accuracy allows them to faithfully reproduce not just total runtime, but also detailed metrics like execution breakdown (exposed compute vs. communication vs. overlap) and Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) utilization.</p> <p>III.3: From Traces to Benchmarks - The Rise of Replay</p> <p>While simulation is powerful, sometimes a lightweight, runnable benchmark is needed for hardware evaluation or regression testing. The “replay as benchmark” paradigm aims to generate such programs directly from execution traces.</p> <p>Mystique is a framework that automates this process for PyTorch workloads <d-cite key="liang2023mystique"></d-cite>. It takes an ET and generates a PyTorch program that replays the original sequence of operators with the same arguments, dependencies, and stream execution patterns. The key advantages are:</p> <ul> <li>Representativeness: The generated benchmarks faithfully reflect the performance characteristics of real, production workloads.</li> <li>Scalability: The process is automated and trace collection has low overhead, allowing for continuous generation of up-to-date benchmarks from a fleet of production models.</li> <li>Portability: The generated benchmarks have minimal dependencies (just PyTorch) and are hardware-agnostic, making them easy to share with external vendors for co-design and evaluation.</li> </ul> <p>Mystique demonstrated that its generated benchmarks could closely match the original models not only in execution time but also in system-level metrics like SM utilization, HBM bandwidth, and GPU power consumption.</p> <p>III.4: Characterizing the Unseen - What-If Analysis and Performance Prediction</p> <p>Perhaps the most powerful application of these trace-driven models is predicting performance for scenarios that haven’t been run. This is crucial for exploring vast optimization spaces without incurring prohibitive hardware costs.</p> <p>Lumos and TraceSim excel at this. By taking a baseline execution graph from a small-scale run, they can manipulate it to model new configurations:</p> <ul> <li>Scaling Parallelism: To predict performance when scaling Data Parallelism (DP), the model can simply substitute the execution times of communication collectives with values predicted for a larger number of GPUs. For Pipeline Parallelism (PP), it can re-partition the layers in the graph and update the pipeline schedule. TraceSim achieved up to 99.5% accuracy in predicting scaled-up performance for GPT-3 <d-cite key="2_Fine_grained_Trace_driven_Pe.pdf"></d-cite>.</li> <li>Changing Model Architecture: To estimate the effect of changing hidden size, the models update the input tensor dimensions and predict new kernel runtimes. To change the number of layers, they can duplicate or remove layer subgraphs. Lumos demonstrated high accuracy in these predictions <d-cite key="2504.09307v1.pdf"></d-cite>.</li> </ul> <p>This predictive capability allows engineers to efficiently answer questions like “Which parallelism strategy is best for this model on 512 GPUs?” or “What is the performance impact of increasing the number of layers by 25%?”—all from a single trace collected on a much smaller system.</p> <p>III.5: A Sharper Focus - Inference and CPU-GPU Dynamics</p> <p>While much work has focused on training, LLM inference presents its own unique performance challenges, especially concerning latency. The SKIP profiler was developed to perform an in-depth analysis of LLM inference workloads, with a special focus on the dynamics of different CPU-GPU coupling architectures (e.g., loosely-coupled PCIe vs. closely-coupled NVLink-C2C) <d-cite key="vellaisamy2025characterizing"></d-cite>.</p> <p>SKIP introduces novel metrics derived from its fine-grained operator-to-kernel dependency graph. The most significant is <strong>Total Kernel Launch and Queuing Time (TKLQT)</strong>, which measures the time between a CPU-side cudaLaunchKernel call and the actual start of the kernel’s execution on the GPU. This metric effectively captures both the CPU overhead of launching the kernel and any queuing delay if the GPU is already saturated.</p> <p>Using TKLQT, SKIP can precisely identify when a workload transitions from being CPU-bound (where latency is dominated by kernel launch overhead) to GPU-bound (where latency is dominated by kernel execution and queuing). This analysis revealed that closely-coupled systems like the GH200 remain CPU-bound up to much larger batch sizes than their loosely-coupled counterparts, highlighting the critical role of CPU single-thread performance in low-batch, latency-sensitive inference scenarios.</p> <p>Part N: Modern Day and Beyond</p> <p>The field of ML performance analysis is far from solved. The continuous evolution of models, hardware, and distributed training techniques presents ongoing challenges and exciting opportunities for future research.</p> <p>N1. Key Challenges and Future Opportunities</p> <p>A comprehensive survey by Guo et al. <d-cite key="guo2024survey"></d-cite> and the future work sections of the reviewed papers point to several key areas:</p> <ul> <li>Fine-Grained Modeling of Compute and Memory: Current models often use high-level estimates (like FLOPS) for computation and simplified assumptions for memory. Future tools need to integrate with detailed architecture simulators (e.g., GPGPU-Sim) to accurately model complex memory hierarchies, including caches, memory pooling, and disaggregated memory systems.</li> <li>Support for Complex Network Topologies: As distributed systems move to higher-dimensional interconnects (4D/5D torus, etc.), simple analytical network models are insufficient. Integrating with detailed network simulators (e.g., ASTRA-sim, ns-3) is necessary to capture effects like congestion and topology-aware routing.</li> <li>Unified Standard Benchmarks: It is currently difficult to compare different modeling tools because they are evaluated on different workloads and metrics. A standardized benchmark suite, akin to MLPerf but for performance prediction tools, is needed to drive progress and allow for fair comparisons. The Chakra project is a step in this direction for trace formats.</li> <li>AI-Enabled Optimization: The ultimate goal is not just to analyze performance, but to automatically optimize it. Future systems could use AI models trained on performance trace data to replace slow, complex modules in a simulator, enabling fast and accurate prediction. This could also power dynamic, runtime optimization systems that use reinforcement learning to adjust scheduling, parallelism, or other configurations on the fly.</li> </ul> <p>Resources</p> <p>A4. Profiling, Tracing, and Modeling Tools</p> <p>Here is a summary of the key tools and frameworks discussed in this review, which are essential for anyone working on ML system performance.</p> <ul> <li>PyTorch Profiler (with Kineto): The primary source of performance data for PyTorch models.
